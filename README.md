# pump-it-up-pad

This is an edit of Alex Diener's ITG2 pad replica schematics to be a Pump It Up pad replica instead, as of writing this there will be some mistakes in the svg file(s) that I've uploaded here, I am a beginner with this stuff, I'll gladly take any pointers you all can give me. 

P.S: Sorry for the bare repo, new to this.
